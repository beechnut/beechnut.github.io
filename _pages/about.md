From 2017–2018, Matt chaired their local neighborhood association. Matt facilitated numerous neighborhood meetings and dialogues involving contentious issues in which neighbors held strong, differing opinions.

With the desire to become more centered amidst conflict, Matt developed their mindfulness practice by completing mindfulness-based yoga teacher training through The New School of Yogic Arts.

During 2020, Matt developed and released Aspen, a computer language that simplifies the creation of networked (graph) data. The language was inspired by their need to model conflicts and social situations.
