  Matt can work with you to build well-considered, clearly-written, organized, maintainable code.
</p>

<p>
  Matt can also help your organization procure right-sized technology solutions.
</p>

<p>
  As a <strong>developer</strong>, Matt is fluent in Ruby and web technology generally, conversant in Javascript and Scala, and most engaged when solving problems creatively, even in new languages. They are intrigued by strongly-typed, compiled, and/or functional languages (e.g. TypeScript, Elm, and Rust).
</p>

<p>
  Matt wrote <a href="https://aspen-lang.org" target="_blank">Aspen</a>, a markup language that transforms plain text to graph data.
</p>

<p>
  As a <strong>software procurer</strong>, Matt has enough experience assessing and developing software to know when firms are pushing burdensome, over-engineered solutions, or are trying to pass off major flaws as minor workarounds. Matt will help you find the technology that will help push your mission forward without weighing you down.
