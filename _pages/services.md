You: need a neutral third party to help guide a difficult  negotiation or conversation. Or, you're in a conflict and feel stuck, with no clear direction to move in.

### Dialogue Facilitation



### Software Development

You need someone who writes clear, maintainable, "confident" code to power your values-driven organization. More importantly, you need someone who can think analytically (e.g. to uncover and solve ambiguities in the spec) and who can communicate clearly.

### General Consulting

A place to include any other types of information that you'd like to include about yourself.
