- name: Aspen
  tagline: Markup language for creating graph data
  status: Released
  color: success
  link: https://aspen-lang.org
  looking_for: users (do you need to analyze social networks?), sponsors, and software developers (Ruby or Scala)
  description: |
    Aspen is a simple computer language that produces graph data (think network
    diagrams or social graphs) from simple annotated text. It's designed to be
    accessible to less-technical users, while being powerful enough for graph
    database developers. Aspen powers Peer, the in-house social analysis software
    used by The Peer Group.

  status: In Development
  color: informational

  description: |
    The Peer Group is a cooperative of individuals with skills in conflict resolution
    and management consulting. We work with small companies, startups, and nonprofits
    at a price point right for those organizations. We help your business or
    organization work through conflicts and get back to your mission.

- name: Some Good Eggs
  tagline: Queer-run co-op making urban agriculture & local food more affordable and accessible
  status: In Development
  color: informational
  looking_for: co-owners, specifically queer and/or BIPOC folks interested in urban agriculture
  description: |
    The City of Somerville, MA allows urban agriculture like gardening and
    chicken-keeping, but even people who want to start a garden or keep chickens
    may not have the time to do the up-front research or be able to cover the startup costs.
    Some Good Eggs would provide everything from advice, to soil testing, to supplies for
    raised garden beds, to infrastructure & supplies for chicken-keeping, all using a
    monthly membership model.

- name: Mediation TV
  tagline: Like Court TV, but featuring mediation and non-authoritative conflict resolution
  status: Idea
  color: inactive
  looking_for: mediators, filmmakers, social media
  description: |
    Unlike a trial or arbitration, mediation doesn't rely on an authority figureâ€”
    settlement is voluntary and, at its best, collaborative and cooperative. There is
    a fascinating drama that comes from the mediation process, and popularizing
    mediation could help people better understand how to resolve their own conflicts,
    and how to see their own biases. This project aims to popularize mediation on
    digital media platforms as a way to influence culture toward non-authoritative
    methods of conflict resolution.

- name: Property Database Analysis
  tagline: Analyzing public property data for public good
  status: Idea
  color: inactive
  looking_for: software developers (graph databases, web, NLP)
  description: |
    Land ownership is a form of power, but the power landscape in a given city
    is not likely to be understood, despite there being open-access property databases.
    Using graph databases, this project seeks to analyze and present answers to
    questions like, "Who owns the most property in the city?", "Who are the
    individuals behind all the shell companies and LLCs?", and "Are there areas
    of the city we should be concerned about getting scooped up by a single developer?"

- name: Ohm - River bioremediation
  tagline: Cleansing polluted riverbeds using robots
  status: Idea
  color: inactive
  looking_for: someone to steal this idea and start working on it
  description: |
    Inspired by Hayao Miyazaki's *Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind*, the
    Ohm project is a collection of small, semi-autonomous, GPS-guided robots.
    These robots slowly crawl a riverbed, ingest soil polluted with PCBs and
    other toxic industrial waste, digest it using microbes and fungi, and,
    when ready, expel clean soil. The ultimate goal is to make formerly
    polluted rivers safe to swim in.
